I am currently a research scientist in machine learning and statistics at Safran Tech, in Paris region. 
My research interests span machine learning interpretability, random forests, causality, and uncertainty quantification.
I am also driven by practical applications and software development.

I have eight years of experience as a machine learning researcher and data scientist in aeronautic/aerospace and tech industries, with also a strong interest in healthcare applications.
I hold a PhD in machine learning and mathematical statistics, on the topic of explainable and interpretable ML (XAI). In my research, I address both the design of new algorithms, and the theoretical analysis of their mathematical properties. 

My resume is available here.


Research interests
==================
* Causal inference (heterogeneous treatment effects)
* Machine learning interpretability (XAI)
* Uncertainty quantification (Bayesian inference, conformal predictions)
* Tree ensembles (random forests, boosted trees)
