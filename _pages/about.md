I am currently a research scientist in machine learning at Safran Tech, in Paris region. 
My research interests span machine learning interpretability, causality, tree ensembles, and uncertainty quantification.
I am also driven by practical applications and software development.

I have eight years of experience as a machine learning researcher and data scientist in aeronautic/aerospace and tech industries, with also a strong interest in healthcare applications.
I hold a PhD in machine learning and mathematical statistics, on the topic of explainable and interpretable ML (XAI). In my research, I address both the design of new algorithms, and the theoretical analysis of their mathematical properties. 

My resume is available [here](https://clementbenard.github.io/files/CV_CBenard.pdf).


Research interests
==================
* Causal inference (heterogeneous treatment effects, causal forests)
* Machine learning interpretability - XAI (variable importance, rule learning, functional decomposition)
* Uncertainty quantification (Bayesian inference, conformal predictions)
* Tree ensembles (random forests, boosted trees)

Software
========
* [Lagun](https://gitlab.com/drti/lagun): platform providing a user-friendly interface to methods and algorithms dedicated to the exploration of numerical simulations and the analysis of datasets (design of experiments, conditional gaussian processes, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty propagation, optimization).
* [sirus](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sirus) (Stable and Interpretable RUle Set): a regression and classification algorithm based on random forests, which takes the form of a short list of rules. SIRUS combines the simplicity of decision trees with a predictivity close to random forests.
* [shaff](https://gitlab.com/drti/shaff) (SHApley eFfects via random Forests): a fast and accurate algorithm to estimate Shapley effects. 
* [sobolmda](https://gitlab.com/drti/sobolmda): the Sobol-MDA is a variable importance measure for random forests, fixing the flaws of Breiman's MDA.
