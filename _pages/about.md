I have eight years of experience as a machine learning researcher and data scientist in aeronautic/aerospace and tech industries, with also a strong interest in healthcare applications.
I hold a PhD in machine learning and mathematical statistics, on the topic of explainable and interpretable ML (XAI). In my research, I address both the design of new algorithms, and the theoretical analysis of their mathematical properties. 
My research interests span interpretability, fairness, random forests, causality, variable importance, uncertainty quantification, deep learning, and rule learning.
I am also driven by practical applications and software development.
